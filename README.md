Pathfinding from Starting node to Ending node. 

This Project is about finding the shortest path from a starting node to one/multiple ending nodes, 
along with obstacles in between.

Algorithms Implemented : 

1. Single Source-Single Destination:

i)Astar Algorithm

ii)Dijkstra Algorithm

2. Single Source-Multiple destinations:

i)Held-Karp Algorithm


=> Each traversal will cost some energy to used up. If Energy is low, you have to Reenergize it first!!

=> It also shows the farthest distance Globetrotter can travel considering the remaining Energy. 

I invested my time in this Project during the lockdown.
